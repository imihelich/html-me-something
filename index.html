          <h3 class="name">Kevin A.K.A. The King of Hell</h3>
          <p>Kevin is horrible. He's bratty and thinks that he's top dog, even though he's the size of a football. It's impossible to hate him though... somehow.</p>

          <h3 class="name">Sheldon A.K.A. Mama's Boy</h3>
          <p>The owner's dachshund. A handsome little weenie with a bowtie. Demands to be held.</p>

          <h3 class="name">Riley A.K.A. Sweet &amp; Spicy</h3>
          <p>Loves hugs and naps. <strong>Warning:</strong> Interrupting naptime may prove hazardous to your health.</p>

        <td>
          <h3 class="name">Nico & Sofie A.K.A. The Dynamic Duo</h3>
          <p>The italian greyhound siblings. No conclusive evidence that they aren't physically attached to one another. Might actually be one two-headed dog?</p>
          <img src="images/NicoSofie.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Two italian greyhounds, one lying on top of the other in a cot."/>

        <td>
          <h3 class="name">Rex A.K.A. The Hot Mess</h3>
          <p>Rex is an instagram thottie trapped in a dog's body. He demands all your attention & contorts into <em>questionable</em> positions for the perfect pic.</p>
          <img src="images/Rex.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="A chunky white boxer with red-brown spots."/>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h3 class="name">April A.K.A. Cuddle Puddle</h3>
          <p>April is the perfect sweetheart. She's always mindful of where she's putting her paws when jumping up for hugs so that she doesn't smack her human in the face.</p>
          <img src="images/April.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="A white standard poodle."/>
